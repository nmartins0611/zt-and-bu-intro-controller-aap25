You can manage playbooks on your server, or by placing your playbooks into a source code management (SCM) system supported by automation controller, including Git, Subversion, and Red Hat Insights.

A *Project* in Ansible automation controller is one or more Ansible playbooks (and related roles, etc.) inside a directory.
Usually, they are in a Source Control Management system like a *git* repository.

We use *Projects* to "_import_" our playbooks into automation controller.
These playbooks might be in a source control management (SCM) like Git (in Github or Gitlab for ex.) or locally.
Automation controller doesn't allow us to create or edit playbooks through the web-UI, we can only "_import_" them into *Projects* which we later run through the Job Templates feature, which we will review further ahead.

In this challenge, you will create your first *Project* which will import a GitHub repository with a few Apache playbooks.
This playbook installs the Apache webserver, starts the service and copies an index.html file.
