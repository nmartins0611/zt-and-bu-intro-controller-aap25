We already have a *Project* called `Apache playbooks` from a previous challenge, where we can find the `apache.yml` and `test_apache_role.yml`  playbooks.

In this new challenge, we are going to create a second project named `Additional playbooks`, which will include the following playbooks: `extended_services.yml` (installs postfix and postgresql), `motd_facts.yml` (sets a message of the day) and `loop_users.yml` (creates multiple users).
