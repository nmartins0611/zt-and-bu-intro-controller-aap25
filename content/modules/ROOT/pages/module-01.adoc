Welcome to Ansible Automation Platform interactive labs!
In this laboratory we will explore the Automation Execution (also known as Automation controller) web-based user interface (web-UI) of Ansible Automation Platform.
+
Through hands-on exercises we will demonstrate how easy it is to use the web-UI of Ansible Automation Platform to run your playbooks.
+
We will start exploring the web-UI, create an *Inventory* to manage our servers, import our playbooks into *Projects*, add *Job Templates* to run our playbooks and finally, create a *Workflow* linking a few of those playbooks through success or failure conditions, to create more complex environments.

The *Overview*  shows a summary of your hosts, projects and inventories.
Each of them are a link to the corresponding objects for easy access.
Right below the resource counts, you will find a Job Activity graph with the executions and below that a card-like summary of the existing Jobs, Projects and Inventories.
+
We will go through all of this sections in the upcoming challenges, while doing hands-on exercises.
