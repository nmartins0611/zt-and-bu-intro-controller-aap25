The *Overview*  shows a summary of your hosts, projects and inventories.
Each of them are a link to the corresponding objects for easy access.
Right below the resource counts, you will find a Job Activity graph with the executions and below that a card-like summary of the existing Jobs, Projects and Inventories.

Access the Schedules view by clicking the "Automation Execution" menu on the left sidebar, then the "Schedules" section.
This view shows all the scheduled jobs that are currently configured and programmed to launch on a regular basis.
They can be used to launch jobs against machines, synchronize with inventory sources, and import project content from a version control system.

= üëã 1.0 - Introduction to automation controller

Welcome to the *Introduction to automation controller* lab.

Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform includes a web-UI and API that allows you to define, operate, scale, and delegate automation across the enterprise.

The new unified UI in Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 has several sections, but for this lab we will focus on the *Automation Execution (Automation controller)* view and features, highlighted below:

image::../assets/Oct-16-2024_at_02.36.20-image.png[Oct-16-2024_at_02.36.20-image.png]

In the following challenges we will build upon the work from the _Writing your first playbook_ laboratory and show you how to run your Ansible playbooks through the web-UI like you would in a corporate environement for operating the automation.

*The screen on the left shows the login screen.
You can log in with the following credentials and then continue on to the tasks:*

____
[!IMPORTANT]

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `ansible123!`
____

= ‚òëÔ∏è Task 1 - Explore the Overview

Explore the *Overview*.
The initial screen will show little information due to the lack of playbooks, hosts, and executions, but take a look now and you will be able to compare once you finished the lab and notice the difference.

You will find the following card-like sections:

* *Resource counts*: This section will show a summary of *hosts*, *projects* and *inventories*
* *Job activity*: This section will show a graph with the past month Job runs
* *Jobs*: A list of recently runned jobs
* *Projects*: A list of recently updated projects
* *Inventories*: A list of recently updated inventories

If you click any of the titles (or "View all" links) it will take you to the corresponding section.
We recommend you take a peek at them.

And last but not least, a new card-like section in Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 that includes quick start guides or interactive howtos: image:../assets/Oct-16-2024_at_02.29.14-image.png[Oct-16-2024_at_02.29.14-image.png]

This new section will be very useful for learning right after you installed Ansible Automation Platform, as you will get instructions for using AAP in the same interface.

= ‚òëÔ∏è Task 2 - Explore the inventories section

Click on the *Inventories* text in the *Overview* or the link in the sidebar menu (under *Infrastructure*) and explore the *Demo inventory* that comes pre-loaded.
For now, just explore the different tabs to familiarize with the fields.
You will create your own soon!

An *Inventory* is a collection of hosts against which playbooks may be launched or run against.
Basically, the "managed nodes" or devices we are automating.
The inventory here is the same as an inventory file you might know from working with Ansible on the command line.

*Inventories* in AAP have several advantages over file based ones, you get all the functionality from the latter ones, with added features and better reusability.

= ‚òëÔ∏è Task 3 - Explore the projects section

In the sidebar menu, under the *Automation Execution* click on the *Projects* submenu and explore the *Demo project* that comes pre-loaded.
You will see all the fields available to use when creating one.
Don't forget to look at the tabs!

*Projects* are logical groups of Ansible playbooks in automation controller.
These playbooks usually reside in a source code version control system like Git (and platforms as Github or Gitlab).
With *Projects* we can reference a repository or directory with one or several playbooks, that we will later use.
