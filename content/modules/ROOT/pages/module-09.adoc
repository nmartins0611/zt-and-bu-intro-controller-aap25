A *Workflow Job Template* is a series of connected automation tasks (or Playbooks) that are executed in a specific order to achieve a desired outcome.
Compared to an individual Playbook (or Job Template), a *Job Template* handles straightforward tasks in a single playbook, while a *Workflow job template* is designed to manage more complex automation scenarios involving multiple playbooks (or Job Templates) and decision-making processes.

* Job templates
* Workflow job templates
* Project syncs
* Inventory source syncs

Only *Workflow Job Templates* have the Workflow Visualizer icon (wf-viz-icon) as a shortcut for accessing the workflow editor.

____
[!WARNING] Remember, do not confuse a *Job Template* with a *Jinja template*, or with *Workflow Job Template*.
They are 3 separate things.
