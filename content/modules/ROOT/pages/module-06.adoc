In automation controller a *Job Template* is a definition and set of parameters for running an Ansible playbook.
Job Templates are useful to execute the same job many times while also encouraging the reuse of Ansible content and collaboration between teams.

To create a *Job Template* you need to have a *Project* (a repository or directory) from which to source our _Playbooks_.
We created our Project in the previous challenge.
Also note that although a *Project* might contain multiple _Playbooks_, a *Job Template* can only run one of those playbooks.
For running multiple Playbooks we will explore the *Workflow* feature further ahead in the  laboratory.

____
[!WARNING] *Do not confuse a Job Template with a Jinja template*.
Jinja templates are used to create dynamic template files, with variables and facts that will be replaced during runtime.
This is very useful for configuration files for example.
If you don't know Jinja, don't worry about it right now, just know that they are different things.
