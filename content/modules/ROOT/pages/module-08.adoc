Let's use what we learned previously and create a second and third *Job Templates*.

* Our *second Job Template* will be named `Extended services` and use the `extended_services.yml` playbook found in the `Additional playbooks` project.
This playbook will deploy a PostgreSQL database in `node3` server, which belongs to the `[database]` group of our `Lab-Inventory`.
* And our *third Job Template* will be named `Set motd` and use the `motd_facts.yml` playbook also found in the `Additional playbooks` project.
This playbook will set a message of the day only in `node1`.

____
[!NOTE] Notice how we can use Playbooks from the same Project in different Job Templates.

= ‚òëÔ∏è Task 1 - Creation of the "Extended services" Job Template

. Expand the *Automation Execution* menu in the sidebar

. For the *Project* field, touch the magnifying glass and select `Additional playbooks`
